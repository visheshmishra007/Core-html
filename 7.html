        <br><li>Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."</li>
        <br><li>Give a man a program, frustrate him for a day. Teach a man to program, frustrate him for a lifetime.</li>
        <br><li>It's not at all important to get it right the first time. It's vitally important to get it right the last time.</li>
    </ul>
