    <p>Web development refers to the process of creating websites and web applications. This involves a combination of
        different technologies and programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create web pages and
        make them interactive.
        Web development can be divided into two main categories: front-end development and back-end development.
        Front-end development deals with the visual aspects of a website or application, including the design, layout,
        and user interface. This involves working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create web pages that can be viewed
        in a browser.
