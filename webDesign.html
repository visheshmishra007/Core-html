        Web design refers to the process of designing the visual appearance and layout of websites. It involves creating
        a visual concept, planning the layout of web pages, selecting color schemes, and choosing typography and images.
        Web designers use various tools and technologies to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites. These
        tools include graphic design software such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Sketch, and Figma. They also
        use programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring their designs to life on the web.
